# Simple-Android-App

## Hilo game created by Weina Dai
This is a very basic app that implements the Hilo Game. Created with Android studio.


## Built With:
Android studio <br>
Java

## Functionality:
A user can load the app and the app will ask the user to guess a number between 1-100. <br>

If a user's guess is lower or higher than the actual number, the app will give hints accordingly so that the user can make a closer guess within the new range. <br>

If a user's guess is correct, the app will congratulate them and start a new game.

## Potential Improvements:
I should add a brief tutorial or hint section for first-time users.<br>
I should add different levels of difficulty to the game and make it challenging, like limiting the number of guesses.<br>
I need to redesign the game's UI to make it more interactive and attractive.
